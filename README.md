# AdjacencyMatrixSolver
Generates and evaluates adjacency matrices stored in .csv format using Dijkstra's algorithm and Floyd's algorithm. Provides time taken to evaluate and shortest paths.

Simply run the matrix generator using 
javac AdjacencyMatrixGenerator.java
java AdjacencyMatrixGenerator

and follow prompts. Once all desired matrices are generated, use the same commands for the solver to extract data(shortest paths and solve times)

In future uses of these algorithms I'll use an adjacency matrix in earnest for Dijkstra's as the current linked structure has a heavy impact on performance.
